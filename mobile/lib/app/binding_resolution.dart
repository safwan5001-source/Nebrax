/// `APP-BUILDER-17` slice 3 — the "collection/template hydration" +
/// "visibility handling" stages of the mandated resolution pipeline
/// (Decision Gate approved, `docs/plans/app-builder/
/// AWJ_APP_BUILDER_COMMERCE_RUNTIME_V1_EVIDENCE.md` §3.5):
///
///   `CompatibilityResolver` -> binding/resource resolution (fetch) ->
///   **this file** -> existing `ComponentRegistry` rendering -> existing
///   `decodeAction`/`AppActionDispatcher.dispatch`.
///
/// Everything here runs on a tree [CompatibilityResolver.resolve] already
/// approved (every `binding`/`visibility` node on it passed capability
/// gating) — this stage never re-checks capability/version support. Its own
/// job is narrower and purely mechanical: turn each `binding` node into its
/// final literal children (repeating a single authored item template once
/// per collected entry, or substituting `itemProps` onto a single bound
/// item), and let a `visibility` node's condition decide, against real
/// runtime signals, whether a node survives into the render tree at all.
/// By the time [resolveNodeBindings] returns, the tree is an ordinary,
/// fully-literal [SchemaComponent] tree — no node carries a `binding` or an
/// unresolved `$item.*` placeholder, exactly as an already-hydrated
/// `hydrateNode` slot looks today. `decodeAction`/`RuntimeActionHandler`
/// need zero changes: action-param substitution happens here, before an
/// action is ever dispatched.
///
/// Deliberately narrow, per the Decision Gate's own constraints:
/// - No arbitrary expressions, no eval: `$item.<field>` is recognized only
///   as an *exact* string value (never interpolated inside a larger
///   string), and `<field>` is a fixed dotted path the schema author wrote
///   at publish time — never a runtime- or merchant-supplied expression.
/// - No arbitrary object traversal: a dotted path only descends through
///   `Map` keys (mirrors `itemProps`'s own field-path convention exactly —
///   see `app_schema.dart`'s `SchemaBinding`); it can never index into a
///   `List`, and it can never reach outside the current item's own JSON
///   object.
/// - Fail-closed per-reference, not per-document: an unresolved segment (a
///   missing field, or a `collect`/`itemProps` target whose *runtime* value
///   does not match the shape `CompatibilityResolver` already validated its
///   *contract* to be) yields `null`/an empty repetition for that one
///   node — never a thrown exception, never a leaked raw `"$item..."`
///   string reaching a widget.
/// - Visibility is presentation-only: hiding a node here is never treated
///   as authorization, and never substitutes for it (server-side
///   authorization stays fully independent, per the Decision Gate's
///   Tenant-Isolation/authorization amendment).
///
/// **Deliberately deferred, matching the approved Slice 3 scope exactly:**
/// a template descendant's *own* `binding` (nested binding-within-a-template)
/// is preserved structurally but not evaluated by this pass — neither
/// Home's `ProductCard` template nor Cart's line template needs one, and
/// evaluating one would mean deciding a resource-fetch/ordering question no
/// evidence has asked for yet. Item-scoped visibility (`$item.*` inside a
/// visibility condition) is the same kind of deferral: `VisibilitySignal`'s
/// own doc comment already names it "a separate decision needing a new
/// contract," so this file never widens `VisibilitySignal` to reach into an
/// item on its own.
